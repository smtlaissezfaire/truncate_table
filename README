TruncateTable
=============

Truncate your table with ActiveRecord::Base.truncate_table!

Works with mysql and sqlite (and others which support either TRUNCATE TABLE or DELETE FROM)

This plugin is especially useful for the 'down' method in a migration which populates a table after creation.


Example
=======

User.truncate_table! removes all users
