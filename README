TruncateTable
=============

Truncate your table with ActiveRecord::Base.truncate_table!

Works with mysql and sqlite (and others which support either TRUNCATE TABLE or DELETE FROM)

This plugin is especially useful for the 'down' method in a migration which populates a table after creation.


Example
=======

User.truncate_table! removes all users


Running Unit Tests
==================

You'll need mysql and sqlite3 installed, as per usual.

Run the following to generate a template for mysql:

  cp spec/mysql_connection.yml.template spec/mysql_connection.yml

Customize spec/mysql_connection.yml.  You'll need to create the mysql database
given in that file.
